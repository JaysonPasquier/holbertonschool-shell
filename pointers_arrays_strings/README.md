## Description
This project focuses on pointers, arrays, and strings in C. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/pointers_arrays_strings
    ```

## Usage
To compile and run any of the C scripts in this directory, use the following commands:
```bash
gcc -o output filename.c
./output
```

## Files
- 0-main.c: Test file for the `0-memset.c` function.
- 0-memset.c: Function that fills memory with a constant byte.
- 1-main.c: Test file for the `1-memcpy.c` function.
- 1-memcpy.c: Function that copies memory area.
- 2-main.c: Test file for the `2-strchr.c` function.
- 2-strchr.c: Function that locates a character in a string.
- 3-main.c: Test file for the `3-strspn.c` function.
- 3-strspn.c: Function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
- 4-main.c: Test file for the `4-strpbrk.c` function.
- 4-strpbrk.c: Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
- main.h: Header file containing function prototypes and definitions.
